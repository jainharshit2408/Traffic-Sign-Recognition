ABSTRACT:
In this project we developed a deep learning model for recognizing street signs using 
the GTSRB dataset. We employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture 
to achieve high accuracy in classifying diverse traffic signs. The model achieved 
outstanding performance, reaching 99.69% accuracy on the validation set and 97.68% 
on the test set. This project has the potential to significantly enhance road safety by 
enabling accurate and real-time sign recognition for autonomous vehicles and driver 
assistance systems.


INTRODUCTION:
Traffic signs are crucial to road safety because they advise drivers about regulations, 
risks, and directions. Accurate sign identification is critical for safe driving, yet complex 
sign variants can pose difficulties for human drivers. This project solves this issue by 
developing a deep learning model that can recognize street signs from the GTSRB 
dataset.


MOTIVATION AND CONTRIBUTION:
Improved road safety: Accurate Street sign recognition allows autonomous vehicles 
and driver assistance systems to respond to traffic restrictions and warnings in an 
appropriate manner, potentially saving lives.
Reduced traffic congestion: Automated sign recognition improves traffic flow by 
allowing cars to change speed and lane in real time depending on sign information.
Driver assistance systems with sign recognition capabilities provide real-time alerts and 
cautions, encouraging alertness and awareness
